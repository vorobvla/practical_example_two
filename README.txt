======================== by Vladimir Vorobyev ============================

This  folder contains my solution of a task I have solved while studying in Czech Technological University in Prague (CTU).
 The task is the final project of Android development course. The task was  designed by  the team of the course's teachers (M. Havryluk and others).

The solution is an Android application that allows to browse entries of specified RSS feeds in one list, to update this list and to manage (to add, browse or remove) the specified RSS feeds.

The directory 'Semestralka'  contains an Android Studio project with the solution.
